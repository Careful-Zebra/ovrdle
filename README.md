# OVRdle

A daily football guessing game. Each round: guess the **overall rating** of 5
footballers, one pinned to each of the last five games (FIFA 22 → EA FC 26).

- 5 players per round, all shown at once, guess them in any order
- 3 tries per player, higher/lower feedback only
- Deterministic daily puzzle (seeded from the date); no player two days running
- Endless **Practice** mode alongside the daily
- Spoiler-free emoji share grid, local stats with streaks and distribution

## Development

No build step. Static HTML + vanilla JS.

```
npm run dev        # serve on http://localhost:5173 (no cache headers - hard-refresh after edits)
npm run validate   # check data/players.json integrity + per-edition rosters
npm run import     # rebuild players.json from a CSV in data/raw/
```
